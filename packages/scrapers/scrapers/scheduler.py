"""
Daily scrape scheduler — stdlib asyncio only (no APScheduler/cron dependency).

The whole pipeline is queue-driven: something must push a job onto
`scrape_queue:requests` or the fleet never runs. Today that only happens via the
HTTP trigger endpoint. This module adds the missing heartbeat: on startup it
schedules a full-fleet scrape every day at a fixed UTC hour and, optionally, a
one-shot catch-up run at boot if none happened recently.

Runs inside the existing FastAPI event loop (started from main.start_consumers),
so it shares the Redis client and adds zero new processes.
