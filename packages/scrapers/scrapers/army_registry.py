"""
Army corps registry + sibling failover (doctrine: Fallback & Support Corps).

Every soldier belongs to a corps; every scout names its siblings. When a
source errors — or a Tier-1 source returns zero leads — the scrape consumer
enqueues ONE bounded compensation wave over the siblings (depth capped at 1,
sources capped at 4) instead of leaving a coverage hole. No chains, no storms.

Corps:
  scouts      every entry in SCRAPER_MAP (discovery soldiers)
  hunters     normalizer (extraction soldier; single, idempotent)
  enrichment  enrichment_queue workers (contact soldiers)
  cleaners    dedup + scoring + verification gates (quality soldiers)
  fallback    DLQ/requeue/reclaim + this compensation map (support soldiers)
  orchestrator scheduler + run_army trigger + wave quality gate (command)
