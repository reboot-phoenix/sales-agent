    would have used (see packages/api/src/utils/sse.ts, which documents this
    channel contract).

    Root-cause fix for invisible background work AND for the cross-tenant leak,
    in one place:

    - army/scheduler runs pass sentinels ("system"/"daily_scheduler") as
      requested_by, so publishing only to user:{requested_by}:sse meant NO
      browser ever received wave completions. Background-triggered lead work is
      therefore addressed through the lead's own audience.
    - The previous broadcast:sse delivered every lead event to every logged-in
      user, so a rep's browser received ids/outcomes for other reps' leads.
      There is no wildcard channel on either side of the contract any more.

    Routing, mirroring the API:
      payload has lead_id -> lead's owners, or shared:sse when UNOWNED (every
        authenticated user may already read unassigned rows, so the channel's
        audience is exactly the set of users permitted to see them); on any
        lookup failure, fail SOFT to the actor's channel rather than widening.
      payload has no lead_id -> ops:sse (admin-only subscribers).
      requested_by is always included (it may be a sentinel; the API ignores
      unknown channel members, so a sentinel is harmless).
    Never raises (fire-and-forget telemetry).
